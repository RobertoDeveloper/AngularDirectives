# AngularDirectives
This repo outlines angular directives that you can reuse throughout your code!
I will also show examples of how to use these directives in your code!


## RefreshIFrame.js
By using Angular's wrapper to jQuery called jQuery Lite, we can refresh the src attribute of the iframe input. This directive is useful when you need to set different urls to a single iframe.
