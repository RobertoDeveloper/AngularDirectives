# AngularDirectives
This repo outlines angular directives that you can reuse throughout your code!
I will also show examples of how to use these directives in your code!


## RefreshIFrame.js
By using Angular's wrapper to jQuery called jQuery Lite, we can refresh the src attribute of the iframe input. This directive is useful when you need to set different urls to a single iframe.

## RestrictKey.js
This directive shows how to attach an event listener to restrict certain keys from the keyboard being entered from an end user. Though, this might seem like a simple example, think about how you can extend this directive by passing attribute values to the directive. For instance, you can pass a number range to restrict certain integers of being entered to the input field.
